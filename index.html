				<h1>Website for your small-business</h1>
				
				<p>
				I am offering websites making for small-businesses and organisations. The service is complex and contains a project, coding and support with hosting (publishing)
				of the website. The project can be presented totally for <b>free</b>. You can decide if you like it and agree or disagree after you will see that. Your ideas and suggestions
				are the base of my project. The main idea I am trying to follow is to answer on your needs and vision. Please contact me, if you are interested in my offer!

				<h1>Maybe do you need some software for your company?</h1>
				
				<p>
				Another branch of my offer is a software that can support your business. The businesess differ in needs (e.g. restaurant and hotel) so their software also has to be different and directed into their appropriate features. I understand that, so each order starts from taking your needs. After that I am preparing a project of the software and then you can decide if you would like to make the order or resign. You can see the project totally <b>for free</b>, so you don't have any cost if you discard the project. 
				At this moment I don't provide payment services in my software projects. Please do not hesitate to contact me, if you are interested!
